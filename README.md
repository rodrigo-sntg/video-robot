  - Sentiment and Emotion analysis with [GotIt](https://gotit.ai/)
  - Sentences analysis using IBM's Watson Natural Language Understanding
  - Rendering with FFMPEG, Kdenlive and After Effects Based on templates
  - Using [Melt framework](https://www.mltframework.org/docs/buildscripts/) to render a video with a xml file.

## Api: Algorithmia ##
It is necessary an apiKey, you can get it on [Algorithmia](https://algorithmia.com/).
on Dashboard look for **Api Keys** e **copie**.

![Algorithmin](https://i.imgsafe.org/ba/ba1d23897c.gif)

put the the data in the folder **./credentials**, in a file named `algorithmia.json`, just like: **Algorithmia** na estrutura abaixo:
``` js
{
  "apiKey": "API_KEY_HERE"
}
```

## Api: Watson ##
You will also need the credentials from *Watson* in [IBM](https://cloud.ibm.com/login).
Look for **catalogue**, inside **IA** search for *Natural Language Understanding*

![IBM](https://i.imgsafe.org/ba/bab0fc4ecd.jpeg)

Click on create on the bottom of the page.
Once the service is created, you'll be redirected to a management page of the service. 
In the left side's menu, look for **Service Credentials** and then **Auto-generated service credentials**.
Then copy the *Credentials* like so:

![IBM](https://i.imgsafe.org/ba/bace46f16b.jpeg)

Put the file again in **./credentials** on a file name `watson-nlu.json`, like this:
``` js
{
  "apikey" : "...",
  "iam_apikey_description" : "...",
  "iam_apikey_name": "...",
  "iam_role_crn": "...",
  "iam_serviceid_crn": "...",
  "url": "..."
}
```

## Setup: Google Cloud Plataform ##
Before creating the api's we are going to need, it's necessary link our google's account with the [Google Cloud Plataform](https://cloud.google.com/), on the page of **Google Cloud Plataform** you'll click in **free trial period**:

![google-cloud](https://i.imgsafe.org/61/61ce83ca22.png)

 Check **Terms And Conditions**

![google-cloud-step1](https://i.imgsafe.org/62/621a2df511.png)

> Obs: It is important to remember that some resources from **Google Cloud Platform** are **paid**, but we are only going to use the free ones.

## Creating the project ##

Now it is time to create the project and link it to the api's.
To do so, just click on the top of the page "**Select Project**" and then click in "**New Project**":

Search for **Custom Search API** on the dropdown and click in "**What credentials do I need?**"

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34013325/55572958-2cc03300-56df-11e9-8bc1-17641ba5138e.png)

The you'll have your API KEY. Copy it and click on finish.
Go back to the project, on the **video-maker/credentials** folder and make a file called **google-search.json** like the example bellow:

```
{
  "apiKey": "API_KEY_HERE"
}
```


## Api: Custom Search Enginer ##
Now we have to configure the customized search engine. To do that, access [Custom Search Engine](https://cse.google.com/cse/create/new), and you'll have to inform the **search site** put **google.com**, and select the language.
Then click in **Advanced Options** and put the more generic schema **Thing**.
We are ready to go. Just click in **Create**:


> PS.: You can get more information about the schema here [schema.org](https://schema.org/docs/full.html)

Back to the **google-search.json**, we have to create the a new property and paste the code copied before, with the id `searchEngineId`:

```
{
  "apiKey": "API_KEY_HERE",
  "searchEngineId": "ID_SEARCH_ENGINE"
}
```
